# 👋 Hi, I’m Kevin!

### 👀 I’m interested in 
Python, data science, programming, food, video games, and measuring human behaviour: somewhere out there is an (extremely complicated) formula that can tell the decisions you *will* make. I want to find it.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning 
Python and Data Science stuff. Still very much a beginner, advice is highly welcome! (e.g. how to format code, ideas to refactor, things I should know or learn)

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 
Hmm.. A food related project would be interesting!
